# 📝 NoteScan

**NoteScan** is a mobile application designed to simplify the digitization of handwritten notes.  
It transforms handwritten content into clean, editable digital text using a device camera, OCR, and LLM-assisted post-processing.


The main goal is simple: **turn paper notes into editable digital format.**

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Capture**  
   The user scans handwritten notes using the mobile camera.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Image enhancement improves contrast, removes noise, and optimizes text regions.

3. **OCR Recognition**  
   The OCR engine extracts raw text from the image.

4. **LLM Post-processing**  
   The language model:
   - fixes recognition errors  
   - restores punctuation  
   - improves formatting and readability  

5. **Edit & Save**  
   Users can edit, search, export, and archive their notes.
